For this project, I will be deconstructing an existing web page and rebuilding it. Links and search boxes will/should not work - 100% perfection not required. 

Goals:

1. Reference Google.com and create a new copy of the homepage with HTML

2. Ignore dropdown menus, form submissions, or hover-highlighting for now

3. Integrate navigation bar and footer

4. Style the homepage with CSS (Center logo, rounded borders, etc.)

5. Use Git and push code to Github when necessary

6. When stuck, seek help (Google search, etc.)

Bonus Objective(s):

1. Build a Google.com search results page

2. Same rules as above
