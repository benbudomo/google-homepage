# Google Homepage

For this project, I will be deconstructing an existing web page (Google.com) and rebuilding it with HTML and CSS. JavaScript or other programming languages will not be present. Links and search boxes will/should not work (unless specified) - 100% perfection not required.

## Goals

* Reference Google.com and create a new copy of the homepage with HTML
* Navigation and Footer links will work
* Ignore dropdown menus, form submissions, or hover-highlighting for now
* Integrate navigation bar and footer
* Style the homepage with CSS (Center logo, rounded borders, etc.)
* Use Git and push code to GitHub when necessary
* When stuck, seek help (Google search, etc.)
