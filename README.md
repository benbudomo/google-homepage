For this project, I will be deconstructing an existing web page and rebuilding it. Links and search boxes will/should not work. 

Goals:

1. Apply what I learned in previous lessons into this project (practice makes perfect).

2. Think about how elements get placed on the page and how they get styled and aligned. 

3. Use the browser's developer tools and get familiar with it.
